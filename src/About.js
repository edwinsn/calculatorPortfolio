                <p>When I was a child, there was a boy who was extremely good at calculations,
                once in a math class, we worked together and I discovered that by giving him
                a possible solution to the problem we were working, he could quickly
                implement it and in this way, after rehearsing a couple of alternatives, we came up with
                an idea whose result was a logical answer , unfortunately we were wrong.
                Nonetheless I think that the combination of the power of calculation
               of machines and human creativity can do great things.</p>
